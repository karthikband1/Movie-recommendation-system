Summary
=======

This dataset  describes 5-star rating and free-text tagging activity from [MovieLens](http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. It contains 22884377 ratings and 586994 tag applications across 34208 movies. These data were created by 247753 users between January 09, 1995 and January 29, 2016. This dataset was generated on January 29, 2016.

Users were selected at random for inclusion. All selected users had rated at least 1 movies. No demographic information is included. Each user is represented by an id, and no other information is provided.

The data are contained in four files, `links.csv`, `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv` and `tags.csv`. More details about the contents and use of all these files follows.

This is a *development* dataset. As such, it may change over time and is not an appropriate dataset for shared research results. See available *benchmark* datasets if that is your intent.
